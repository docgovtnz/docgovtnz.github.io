Code contributions are welcomed to our open source projects. This should be done by means of GitHub pull requests to the relevant projects. Pull requests will be reviewed by project maintainers and discussed and potentially integrated accordingly. Each pull request should be specific to one single bug and/or feature to facilitate its integration into the code base.

Please note that to contribute code, you must abide by our [Code of Conduct](./contributingCodeOfConduct.md) and you must own the copyright to your contributions.

For all security vulnerabilities these should be reported as per our [Responsible Disclosure Guidelines](https://www.doc.govt.nz/footer-links/privacy-and-security/responsible-disclosure-guidelines/).

Project maintainers are happy to have a k≈çrero over email at <opensource@doc.govt.nz>.
